        <div class="Broncos">
          <p>(In Season) The Broncos rising star running back Philip Lindsay is 8th in the leauge in rushing years with 198
            rushing yards and the face of the team von miller hope to take down the red hot Chiefs
            on Monday night football. Despite last weeks loss the Broncos are hungry to take on
            division rival Cheifs, Patrick Mahomes has been a freight train and him and the Cheifs
            offense have averagedat least 40 points in each game.<br /><br />
            Some of the best players since the beginning on the Broncos are:
            <ol>
              <li>John Elway QB</li>
              <li>Terell Davis RB</li>
              <li>Peyton Manning QB</li>
              <br />
              <br />
            </ol>
            <p>
              During Elways' time in the NFL, he demostrated what a Hall of
              Fame quarterback should look like wih his arm, mentality and his mobility. Terell Davis went from a nobody to one of the franchises
                best players without question. Peyton Manning, a more recent star, faced tremendous challenges with a neck injury, yet he bounced
                back and led the Broncos to 2 superbowls in 5 years winning 1 and riding
                into the sunset as a Superbowl champion before his retirement.
