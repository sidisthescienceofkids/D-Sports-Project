        <p>(Offseason) Despite of last season's disapointing end, the Nuggets hope to turn things around with newly aquired Isaiah
          Thomas. Last year the Nuggets had a heartbreaking end to the season losing the game that would get them into the playoffs
          but this year, with new faces coming to the Pepsi Center, the Nuggets hope to steal a
          playoff spot and compete against teams like the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers,
          Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder.<br /><br />
          Some of the best players in the league are right down here:
          <ul>
            <li>LeBron James</li>
            <li>Stephen Curry</li>
            <li>James Harden</li>
            <li>Kevin Durant</li>
            <li>Giannis Antetokounmpo</li>
            <li>Anthony Davis</li>
            <li>Russell Westbrook</li>
            <li>Kawhi Leonard</li>
            <li>Joel Embiid</li>
            <li>Damian Lillard</li>
            <br />
            <br />
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
          You may notice we do not have any of the Nuggets in the top 10, but a firm and ready to play Isaiah Thomas is coming in around the
          top 25 players in the NBA, and our team ranked around 14th in the 2017-2018 NBA season. Hopefully we can come back from this drought
          and fight for our position in the top 10 teams in the NBA.
